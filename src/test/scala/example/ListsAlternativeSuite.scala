/**
 * This class implements a ScalaTest test suite for the methods in object
 * `Lists` that need to be implemented as part of this assignment. A test
 * suite is simply a collection of individual tests for some specific
 * component of a program.
 *
 * A test suite is created by defining a class which extends the type
 * `org.scalatest.FunSuite`. When running ScalaTest, it will automatically
 * find this class and execute all of its tests.
 *
 * Adding the `@RunWith` annotation enables the test suite to be executed
 * inside eclipse using the built-in JUnit test runner.
 *
 * You have two options for running this test suite:
 * 
 * - Start the sbt console and run the "test" command
 * - Right-click this file in eclipse and chose "Run As" - "JUnit Test"
